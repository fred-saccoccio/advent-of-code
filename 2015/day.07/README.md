# Day 07

In order to solve this challenge, one can say I made it big :
* Used C++,
* Developped a tiny virtual machine to get the result,
* Developped a lexical analyzer and a parser with Flex and Bison to feed the VM,
* Added an instruction (QUERY?) to query any wire level.

I could see a lot of simpler solutions on the Web but it was fun and refreshing
to use Flex anbd Bison as they are so powerful tools.
